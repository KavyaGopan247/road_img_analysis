        "\"create a simple sample application or system for road surveillance that will use cameras, sensors and real time images to help road users know what's happening on roads in real time.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "**Approach:**\n",
        "Leveraging pre-trained models, we preprocess data from various sources including traffic and weather sensors, alongside images from surveillance cameras. By classifying these images, we obtain actionable insights into road conditions, enabling efficient incident detection and route optimization. The following steps outline our approach:\n",
        "\n",
        "Steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Data Preprocessing: We start by preprocessing the real-time data, which includes traffic and weather information, as well as images captured by surveillance cameras. This step ensures that the data is appropriately formatted and ready for analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Image Classification: Using a pre-trained image classification model, such as MobileNetV2, we classify the images obtained from the surveillance cameras. This allows us to identify various elements on the road, including vehicles, pedestrians, and road conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Incident Detection: We employ machine learning techniques to detect incidents such as accidents and road closures based on the results of image classification. By analyzing the categories assigned to the images, we can identify patterns indicative of potential incidents.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Route Optimization: Finally, we optimize routes based on the analyzed data. By considering detected incidents and other relevant factors, we recommend the most efficient routes for road users, thereby minimizing delays and improving overall traffic management."
